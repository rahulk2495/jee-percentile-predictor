### How to use this predictor?
1) You can use the inbuilt dummy data in the app to see how this app works
2) Read the "📂 Data Requirements" section below properly to create the dataset for predictions
3) Make sure that you data is coded as written in "📂 Data Requirements" section and with exactly same coloumn names
4) Try not to upload files with student names and phone numbers or any other personal information, you can use the student IDs 

### 📂 Data Requirements
Upload an **Excel file (.xlsx)** with columns (Make sure the columns are named as follows):
- `female` (1 for female and 0 for male)  
- `tenth_math_final` (10th CBSE Mathematics score out of 100)  
- `tenth_sci_final`  (10th CBSE Science score out of 100)
- `pcm` (1 for PCM and 0 for PCMB)
- `general` (1 for general student and 0 otherwise)
- `obc` (1 for OBC and 0 otherwise)
- `sc`  (1 for SC and 0 otherwise)
- `st`  (1 for ST and 0 otherwise)

### ⚙️ Detailed overview of JEE Percentile Predictor  

### 📖 What Regression Means  
Regression is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between one **outcome variable** (here: JEE Mains Percentile) and a set of **predictor variables** (like gender, class 10 math/science marks, PCM VS PCMB, and social categories).  
In simple terms:  
> Regression finds the **best-fitting equation** that can predict JEE Mains Percentiles from a student’s background and academic data.
                       
            
### 📘 About This Model
This model predicts **JEE Mains Percentiles** using:
- Gender
- Class 10th Math & Science scores (with quadratic terms)
- PCM stream indicator (PCM VS PCMB)
- Social category (General, OBC, SC, ST)


            
            
            
            
            
### 📘 Regression Equation for Predicted Percentile

        
Predicted Percentile = 196.20  - 6.34 × Female  - 2.53 × Math + 0.0202 × Math²  - 2.54 × Science + 0.0198 × Science²  + 3.02 × PCM  - 0.32 × General  - 0.87 × OBC  - 0.61 × SC



### ✅ Accuracy (from regression)
- R² = **0.428** About 43% of variation in JEE Mains Percentiles is explained by this model 
- Adj R² = **0.368**  
- Root MSE = **19.0** ((average prediction error is ~19 percentile))
            
### ✅ Accuracy (from Prediction)
- **Accuracy = 80.2%**  
  > Percentage of all students correctly predicted (both qualified & not qualified).  
- **Sensitivity (Recall for Qualified) = 48.0%**  
  > Of all students who actually qualified, how many were correctly predicted as qualified.  
- **Specificity (Recall for Not Qualified) = 92.9%** 
  > Of all students who did not qualify, how many were correctly predicted as not qualified.
- **Sensitivity (true positives / qualified detected)**: 72.6%
